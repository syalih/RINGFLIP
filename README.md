# RINGFLIP — One‑button Circular Runner

RINGFLIP is a minimalist, single‑page web game designed for **instant fun, flow, and challenge**. The player runs along a circular ring and flips between the inside and outside to avoid spikes. With just **one button**, the game is simple to learn but hard to master.

## 🎮 Gameplay
- You orbit around a circular track.
- **Control:** Press **Space**, tap, or click to *flip* between the inside and outside of the ring.
- **Goal:** Avoid spikes by being on the opposite side when passing them.
- **Scoring:**
  - +5 points for each safe pass
  - Hit a spike → game over (unless Zen mode is on)
- Difficulty ramps up as speed increases over time.

- **Zen Mode** → no deaths, penalties instead
